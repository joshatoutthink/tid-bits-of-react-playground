# My Sandbox  

##  Goal

I want to this site to be a resource for me first and then others. This is not a portfolio, or a blog but a well designed functional site for reference things I have done in the past. 

## Post Types
- ### Components: 
  - A fun playground to build interesting components. Experiment with different apis
- ### Brain Dump: 
  - Just that if I learn something or write some code that I may want to reference later. I will put it here. The format is very Free Form. 

## Future Post Types:
- ### Gists:
  - I would pull in all my gists, and also be able to edit or create new ones like my chrome extension gist'n it



## TODOs
- style the site.
- add a search feature.
- make it easier to write posts
